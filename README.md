# Task 1 - JSON

The solution to the task is cli command **task:json** with two required parameters:
1) file name of tree as json format
2) file name of list as json format
3) and not-required file with output data. If file name has been added, the result will be saveing in thi file, else will be automaticly creating new file with name "**tree_out.json**".

All files must be in directory "**data/UpdateJsonCommand/**" in root project directory.
